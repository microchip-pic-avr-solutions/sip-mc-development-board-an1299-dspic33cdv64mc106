    <p align="left">
       <img  src="images/idedeviceselection.png"></p>
  

2. Set the project **pmsm.X** as the main project by right-clicking on the project name and selecting **Set as Main Project** as shown. The project **pmsm.X** will then appear in **bold.**
    <p align="left">
     <img  src="images/ideprojectsetup.png"></p>
 

	
3. Open <code>**userparms.h** </code> (**pmsm.X > Header Files**) in the project **pmsm.X.**  
     - Ensure that the macros <code>**TUNING</code>, <code>OPEN_LOOP_FUNCTIONING</code>, <code>TORQUE_MODE</code>, and <code>SINGLE_SHUNT</code>** is not defined in the header file<code> **userparms.h.**</code>
          <p align="left"><img  src="images/configParam.png"></p>

     - When internal amplifiers are used for current amplification (referred to as **internal op-amp configuration**), **define** the macro <code>**INTERNAL_OPAMP_CONFIG**</code> in <code>**userparms.h.**</code>
          <p align="left"> <img  src="images/internalopampconfig.png"></p>
     - Otherwise, if external amplifiers are used for current amplification (referred to as **external op-amp configuration**), undefine the macro <code>**INTERNAL_OPAMP_CONFIG**</code> in the header file <code>**userparms.h.**</code>
        <p align="left"><img  src="images/externalopampconfig.png"></p> 

> **Note:**</br>
>The motor phase currents can be reconstructed from the DC Bus current by appropriately sampling it during the PWM switching period, called a single-shunt reconstruction algorithm. The firmware can be configured to demonstrate **the single shunt reconstruction algorithm** by defining the macro <code>**SINGLE_SHUNT**</code> in the header file <code>**userparms.h**</code> 
>For additional information, refer to Microchip application note **AN1299, “Single-Shunt Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Algorithm for Sensorless FOC of a PMSM.”**
>By default, the firmware uses phase currents measured across the phase shunt resistors on two of the half-bridges of the three-phase inverter (**‘dual shunt configuration’**) to implement FOC.
